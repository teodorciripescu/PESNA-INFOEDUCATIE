 Pesna What is that sound? *
 Chapo I was waiting for you Pesna, ever since your father banished you *
 Pesna I was not banished... My father told me to find what had been lost a .n long time ago. *
 Chapo You are not better than your brothers Pesna, you were always in their .n shadow and you will always be. *
 Pesna This is not about my brothers. If they were better than me, why .n did't my father send them to find the relic? *
 Chapo The relic doesn't even exist Pesna. Your father wants you dead that's .n why he sent you. *
 Pesna You can't fool me, monster! Now, get out of my way, .n unless you want to die! *
 Chapo You insolent child, I will make you to beg for mercy. You shall perish .n under my club! *
